# TB-ScalesOfConviction
Turn Based Game Assignment

Take turns to Gather Points in the overworld in order to buff yourself and enter combat with an advantage over your enemies.

# To play the build:
Download the 'ScalesOfConviction-TestBuild' directory and run the executable inside.

# How to play:
Walk over as many green effect tiles as you can before clashing with the enemy, which will engage in a one-on-one duel. The effect tiles grant you stat bonuses. You can either strike quick before the enemy has a chance to collect the buffs scattered on the board, or you can try to grab all of them before initiating the encounter. Your performance results will be displayed upon victory or defeat.
